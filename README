Quick app to try out some more python and also uses/runs on Google app engine.

I use Sleep Cycle app on the iPhone to record my sleep. You can export the data.
I've created this app to give more info/stats from the data. With the export
functionality in the app, one can email the data directly to this web app on
Google app engine, which will parse and add the data, so that the next time one
visits the page, it will have the data. Useful for viewing more stats for
one's own sleep data only.
To use this, you will need to open Google app engine account and upload the
app.
